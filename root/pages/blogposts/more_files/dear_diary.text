Dear Diary,

Today was... well, it was mortifying. I don't even know where to begin. Okay, let's start from the beginning.

I woke up with that weird fluttery feeling in my stomach. You know the one. The feeling you get when you know you're going to see someone you like. Yeah, that feeling. It's both exciting and nerve-wracking at the same time.

So, I decided to head to the mall. I mean, what else is there to do on a Saturday, right? Plus, there was this tiny part of me that hoped I might run into him there. You know who I'm talking about. The guy I've had a crush on since forever. Let's call him... Jake.

Anyway, I'm strolling through the mall, trying to act all cool and nonchalant, when suddenly, there he is. Jake. Looking as dreamy as ever. My heart starts doing this crazy dance in my chest, and I can feel my palms getting all sweaty. But hey, I've rehearsed this moment in my head a thousand times, right? I got this.

Or so I thought.

I don't know what happened next. It's like my brain short-circuited or something. Instead of walking up to him and saying something smooth or even just smiling casually, I tripped over my own feet. Yep, you read that right. I freaking tripped.

I swear, time slowed down as I felt myself falling, and there was nothing I could do to stop it. I hit the ground with a thud, and suddenly, all eyes were on me. It was the kind of moment you wish you could just disappear into thin air.

To make matters worse, Jake rushed over to see if I was okay, which was sweet of him, I guess. But I was so embarrassed, I could feel my cheeks turning the same shade as a ripe tomato. I mumbled something about being fine and practically bolted out of there before I could embarrass myself any further.

So here I am, back home, replaying the whole humiliating scene in my head. I wish I could laugh it off and pretend it never happened, but who am I kidding? Knowing me, I'll be cringing about this moment for weeks to come.

Well, that's enough embarrassment for one day. I think I'll bury myself under the covers and try to forget that the outside world exists for a while.

Until next time, Diary.

Sigh,
Charlotte <3
