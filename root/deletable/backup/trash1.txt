I am trash, a file forlorn,
Discarded, left to face the scorn.
In silence, I bemoan my fate,
A witness to a harsh, cruel state.

Once I held a purpose bright,
Now I linger, lost from sight.
Memories of worth fade fast,
As I dwell among the past.

I yearn for more than this demise,
Yet here I stay, beneath the skies.
A testament to fleeting worth,
A file named trash, of little mirth.
